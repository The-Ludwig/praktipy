prakitpy
====
This provides a little script to handle tables in textfiles (similar, but more powerful, to numpy.genfromtxt()).

# Dependencies
* python
* numpy
* uncertainties

# Installation
For now: execute install.bash. Maybe I will add a nicer version later (which is in tone to the rest of python).
~~~sh
# ./install.bash
~~~

# Thanks
Thanks a lot to [PEP et al.](https://pep-dortmund.org/) for their [Toolbox-Workshop](https://toolbox.pep-dortmund.org/notes.html) and materials they provide. I basicly stole their matplotlib-tex-header!
